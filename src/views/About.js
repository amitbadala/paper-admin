        <p>
          I love javascript and everything on web, when my dev-senses kick in I
          build presumably awesome stuff. I've always been drawn to the overlap
          between design and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have built a diverse range of applications across different
          industries and have led the architecture of several Front End & Back
          End projects from scratch.
